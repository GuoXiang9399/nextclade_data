### SARS-CoV-2 

#### New dataset version (tag `2021-09-30T20:13:05Z`)

 - Clades: changed name of clade "21H" to "21H (Mu)", as it became a WHO VoC
 - Reference tree: masked a number of mutations that were either homoplasic (occurred independently in multiple lineages) or were error-prone, to prevent these mutations from distorting the tree is now produced from a dedicated workflow thatâ€™s openly available and thus reproducible
 - Reference tree: changed sequence filtering to improve diversity on the tree, while excluding low quality sequences. For this we use the list of designated pango lineages.
 - Included newer sample data

The Augur workflow for reference tree generation is now available at [TODO: add a link to the workflow](https://example.com)
