## Clades of seasonal influenza viruses

The WHO Collaborating centers define "clades" as genetic groups of viruses with signature mutations to facilitate discussion of circulating diversity of the viruses.
Clade demarcation do not always coincide with significantly different antigenic properties of the viruses.
