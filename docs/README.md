# Nextclade dataset documentation

## Dataset migration from version 2 to 3
Version 2 dataset are not compatible with Nextclade v3 and need migrating.
See our [dataset migration guide](migration-guide-v3) for tips and tools on how to create v3 dataset from your existing v2 datasets.


## Create new datasets
You can create your own NextClade datasets!
We provide a [dataset creation tutorial](dataset-creation-guide) to help you assemble datasets for your virus of interest. To help you to get going, there is a [minimal dataset](minimal-dataset) and a [script](example-workflow/scripts/generate_from_genbank.py) to walk you through the creation of a suitable annotation using data from RefSeq.

## Contribute datasets to a collection on NextClade

If you want your dataset to be included in those served by the Nextclade Web application, you can create a pull request in this repository.
The [dataset curation guide](dataset-curation-guide) describes the relevant steps.
